# bypassV3

The main.py file shows how you can bypass ReCaptcha V3 on different websites. It will not work for every website but it worked on quite a few websites I tested on.

This bypass will only work for recaptcha V3 so the hidden recaptcha V2 will not work. Before testing check the post data and see if it says the captcha token is V3.
If it says something like `g-recaptcha-response` it is most likely hidden V2.
